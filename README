The AmavisNewSQL SquirrelMail plugin lets users change a pre-defined set of
SpamAssassin settings when those settings are stored in a SQL DB
rather than a config file. It also allows you to use a quarantine database
for questionable mail. This plugin was designed with enterprise use in mind.

The primary difference between this plugin and some others.. is that it is
designed to work with amavis-new rather than SpamAssassin directly. If you
have a large or high volume site.. amavis-new is the preferred way of doing it.



REQUIREMENTS

o SquirrelMail 1.4x

o PEAR Supported Database (tested with recent versions of Postgres and MySQL)
  http://pear.php.net/packages.php

o Pear Net/SMTP (for resending quarantine messages)
o Pear Log (for the process_bsmtp.php)
o Pear DB

o htmlMimeMail Class (included, for digest mailings)

o This plugin can not use the native SquirrelMail options database
  so you will need a database just for these amavis-new settings.
  (see the included schema file)

o This plugin makes use of a quarantine system for messages that would normally
  be blocked.  Please use the provided process_bsmtp.php script from this
  package instead of the one that ships with spamassassin.. Please see the
  section on the Quarantine DB settings for how to configure it.





INSTALLATION

o These directions assume you already have a working install of amavis-new
  with spamassassin, SquirrelMail and the database installed.

o Create the directory .notstored under your spamquarantine directory
  (usually /var/virusmails)  and make it owned by the amavis user.  When
   a message is not able to be processed it will be placed in this directory
   and an error written to the mail log.

o Install PEAR modules - Usually just 'pear install <module>'

o Unpack in the plugins directory of your SM installation.

o Copy config.php.dist to config.php and edit config.php to change the
  DSN and domain names for your webmail URL and digest mailings.

o Create the amavis user account in your database

o Create the database called amavis owned by the amavis user.

  NOTE - If using Postgres be sure to set the encoding to SQL_ASCII
         ie: CREATE DATABASE "amavis" WITH TEMPLATE = template1 ENCODING = 0;

o Import the schema file in the utils directory appropriate for your DB
   - Default schema files are provided for Postgres and MySQL

o Edit cleanquarantine.php and set the path info.

o Edit generatedigest.php and set the path info.

o If you don't want to run the cron scripts directly from the plugin directory
  or if you are running them from a different system

  - Create the directory /usr/local/amavisnewsql
  - Copy (or symlink) the following things to /usr/local/amavisnewsql
    - process_bsmtp.php
    - cleanquarantine.php
    - generatedigest.php
    - config.php
    - amavisnewsql.class.php

o Edit the process_bsmtp.php script and change the BASEINCLUDE setting to
  match your directory. This script must be located on the same system with your
  amavis-new install since it picks up quarantined messages and places
  them in the database.


o Set up cron jobs for cleanquarantine.php, process_bsmtp.php and
  generatedigest.php (suggested entries listed below)

o In amavisd.conf change the default sql statement for
  $sql_select_white_black_list to the following:

$sql_select_white_black_list = 'SELECT wb FROM wblist'.
  ' WHERE (rid=?) AND (wblist.email IN (%k))'.
  ' ORDER BY wblist.priority DESC';

o Also in amavisd.conf be sure to enable sql lookups with
  @lookup_sql_dsn to match your database settings.

o Also in amavisd.conf Use the bsmtp methods:

  $virus_quarantine_method = "bsmtp:$QUARANTINEDIR/virus-%i-%n.bsmtp";
  $spam_quarantine_method = "bsmtp:$QUARANTINEDIR/spam-%b-%i-%n.bsmtp";

  $virus_quarantine_to = 'virus-quarantine';


o Enable the amavisnewsql plugin.





QUARANTINE DB

This plugin supports a spam/virus quarantine where messages
can be stored and reviewed.. released or automaticly deleted.

Here is how it works...

1. If a message crosses the user settable upper threshold amavis-new
   will stash it in a quarantine folder (/var/virusmails by default)

2. A cron script included with this plugin (process_bsmtp.php)
   will scan that directory and place all messages into the
   database.

3. Another cron script (generatedigest.php) will scan the database once a day
   and send a 'digest' email to each user showing what is in their
   quarantine.  The frequency of this mailing is settable for each user.
   The digest will only contain the sender address, subject, date and SA score.

4. If mail sits in the quarantine long enough.. it will be cleaned up
   by a third cron script (cleanquarantine.php) which will remove
   everything older than a certain number of days.. settable for each user.




Suggested cron entries are:

*/5 * * * * root /usr/local/amavisnewsql/process_bsmtp.php
0 15 * * * root /usr/local/amavisnewsql/cleanquarantine.php
30 16 * * * root /usr/local/amavisnewsql/generatedigest.php

I use 4:30pm so that people may review their quarantine before the work day
is over and still have a high chance of seeing everything from that day.





DIGEST MAILINGS

If you want to let your users know what is sitting in their mail
quarantine from time to time.. use the generatedigest.php script.

Edit the first line of generatedigest.php to point to the location
of your php binary.

To format and send mail messages I use the htmlMimeMail class
which I include in this tarball. The original can be found at
http://www.phpguru.org/mime.mail.html

To install the class do this as root:

  mv htmlMimeMail-2.5.1 /usr/local/lib/php

  chown -R root.root /usr/local/lib/php/htmlMimeMail-2.5.1/

  ln -s /usr/local/lib/php/htmlMimeMail-2.5.1 /usr/local/lib/php/htmlMimeMail


The script will lookup the value of the 'digest' field in the 'users' table
from the amavis database. It will mail Monthly users on the first of the
month.. and Weekly users on Friday at whatever time you set in the cron job.





SUPPORTED SPAMASSASSIN SETTINGS

This plugin only allows the users to change a subset of all possible options for
amavis-new/spamassassin.  This is done on purpose as to not make things more
complicated than they need to be for the masses.

o whitelist / blacklist
o tag2 Score Level
o Kill (Quarantine) Score Level

This plugin alone does not provide any administrative tools or front end to
manage all the users data... all main functions are in a class though so that
you may incorporate that management into your own tools.  I am also working on a
cyrus/ldap management system that also ties into this plugin.  This project is
at http://sourceforge.net/projects/ldapcyradm/  It is still in CVS at this point
but it is very complete...  it just requires a lot of custom ldap settings to
adapt to your site.




FAQ

Q: How is this plugin different from the other many SpamAssassin plugins for SM?

A:    This plugin is specifically for use with Amavis-New which calls
   SpamAssassin. The database schema is very different between the two setups
   and at the time of writing this there was not an amavis specific plugin
   out there.  This also allows you to use a database quarantine.



Q: How can I adjust the default policy settings?

A:    These defaults are set on the database columns.. using your admin
   tool of choice... simply change the default on each column.



Q: What if I don't want to use the quarantine database?

A:    If you do not wish to use the quarantine database you must change things in two
   places.   In the config file find variable $CONFIG["use_quarantine"] and change
   it to false. Also.. in the database.. on the policy table you will need to remove
   the default setting for column spam_quarantine_to and delete that column for policy id 2
   (from the default schema). That will ensure new users don't have their mail
   quarantined.

A2: With 0.8.0 it is now possible to turn the quarantine on and off as a per user setting.
    The only options are either on.. which will quarantine high scoring messages.  Or
    reject which will cause amavis-new to reject them after processing.



Q: My users have multiple addresses on their account.. how does this work?

A: Since the number of possible email addresses that can be associated with an account is
   near infinate.. I chose to simplify the process of keeping track by making an assumption.
   My code assumes that for a given account..  all possible valid email aliases have been
   rewritten back to one base address.  A system address if you like.  This is the address
   that is used to match the user up between SQM, amavis-new, and my plugin.  In postfix
   I do this with virtual alias tables that are re-created once an hour by a script.



Q: I'm seeing the error "Recipient X does not exist in the database... "

A: You should never see this in a properly working setup. The way amavis-new decides to
   quarantine a message is by first looking up the recipient in the database.. checking
   their policy settings.. and then writing the bsmtp file only if everything is in
   agreement.  If a recipient is not in the database the query should return the
   'catch all' user which has the quarantine turned off.  So... if you are seeing bsmtp
   files created for people who are not in the database..  there is a problem somewhere
   since those files shouldn't be created if everything is configured correctly.



Q: Where can I find more about how/why things are done?

A: If not answered here.. check table comments in the database or read the source..
   My coding is not /that/ hard to follow.


Q: Should I use mysql or postgres?

A: For this.. I can only give my personal preference.  I like and use postgres in
   in production at work.  There are lots of reasons I could give you for this choice
   like the advanced features (which I can't use because I maintain compat with mysql),
   better (more free) license, the fact that postgres will not silently change
   data as it's being inserted (as mysql can do in certain situations), or even
   how they both perform under heavy load.  There are many reasons people automatically
   think of mysql when they think DB under linx.. but while lesser known.. postgres
   is a better choice for important things I believe.  Please don't write me with
   near-meaningless benchmark reports of how mysql is (faster|better|cheaper) or how
   everyting is fixed in the latest version X... you won't change my mind.. I have
   seen it all before. =]


KNOWN BUGS

o  Not all amavis-new settings are visible to the end user.  Yes I know that..
   it's not a bug so much as a non-feature.  I believe to show everything would
   be too confusing to the average user.. and not provide any real benefit.
