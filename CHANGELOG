CHANGELOG - Started with version 0.8.0


0.8

o Added the ability to turn the quarantine off on a per user basis.
   - If a user has one of the predefined policys active and the choose to not use the quarantine
     it will create them a custom policy with the same tag/kill values as they had before.  Once they
     have a custom policy in affect... if they choose a predefined policy it will switch to that.. and
     remove the custom policy from the policy table.. loosing their custom scoring values and restoring
     the use of the quarantine.

o Fixed quarantine display to show a page header even when no messages are in the quarantine.

o Moved the code that adds a new user into the amavis database to be run from setup.php instead
  of amavisnewsql.php.  This has the affect that new users will be added the first time they
  log into webmail instead of the first time they visit the plugin options page as before.
  An assumption had to be made in relation to the persons email address.. Now when a new user
  logs into webmail for the first time.. it will create an email address based on
  their username and the default domain from the config file.  The code where this happens
  is in the setup.php file around line 60. You should customize this part if it does not work
  with your site.  If they already have an email address set in the personal info section of SQM
  it will use that. Make sure this email address matches the 'base address' if you use multiple
  addresses per account. See the FAQ in the readme for an explanation.

o Reordered the process of storing quarantined messages in process_bsmtp.php.  Now..  if a
  recipient is not in the database the message in question will not be stored.  Please see
  the FAQ in the readme about this issue.  Thanks for the tip on this to Nick Davis

o Limited the digest mailing to the top 100 lowest scoring messages

o The quarantine page now limits the number of messages per page... it uses the same value
  as the 'Number of Messages to Index' option on the Display Preferences page.

o cleanquarantine.php script has been updated to also remove all messages that are not owned
  by anyone in the users table.  I know this has been a problem for some sites...

o Moved the listQuarantineMessages function from the generatedigest script into the class.

o Changed quotestring to use the php addslashes function for storing emails in the database.

o Changes to support virtual domains.  If the username is passed in with an @ sign it will
  (for a new user) use that for the email address as well.  If it does not have an @ sign it
  will assemble an email from the default domain set in the config file.
