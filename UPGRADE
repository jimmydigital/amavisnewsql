0.8.0
  
  Big changes in all scripts... and a slight change in the config file and class interface.
  You will need to replace what you have with the 0.8 versions if you are upgrading from 
  a 0.7.x version.  To your existing config file add the default_domain option.. see the 
  example config for details.
  
  Make sure you have created the .notstored directory... check out step 2 under the
  install directions.

The biggest change for this release is that I've eliminated the perl scripts..
so now everything uses a common class and config file.

Starting with version 0.7 process_bsmtp.php is the script to use to inject quarantined
messages into your database.  If you have problems getting it to work.. the similar
perl scripts from the 0.6 release may also be used (for now).  In the 0.8 release I plan to
add support for master/slave replicated databases and the perl versions will not be updated.

To support this new script you will need to install PEAR Log.
